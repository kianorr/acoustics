# acoustics

This project was a simulation on the distribution of sound within a rectangular concert hall. The sound absorption coefficient, alpha, is adjustable, as well as the size of the hall.

The simulation was made in 2018 and presented at IVC symposium and won the UCI HTCC Abstract Award.

NOTE: I didn't code the reflections of the back wall, but those reflections are assumed to be negligible because of how weak they would be. Also, the documentation for this isn't great because I never got around to doing so.
