# acoustics

This project was a simulation on the distribution of sound within a rectangular concert hall that I made in 2018. The sound absorption coefficient, alpha, is adjustable, as well as the size of the hall.

Also, the documentation for this isn't great because I never got around to doing so.

NOTE: I didn't code the reflections of the back wall because I ran out of time, but those reflections are assumed to be negligible because of how weak they would be.
